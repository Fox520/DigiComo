# DigiComo
[DigiComo](https://www.digicomo.com/online-store) conceptual ecommerce application.

## Getting started
Requires Python 3

pip install -r requirements.txt

NB: this project was made in rush to see what I come up with using [MDBackdrop](https://github.com/HeaTTheatR/KivyMD/wiki/Components-Backdrop). Therefore bugs are in there.
